    "# üìÑ Assignment 3 Report: Predictive Modeling of Dry Bean Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Objective\n",
    "The objective of this analysis was to examine the Dry Bean Dataset and develop a regression model to **predict the perimeter of a dry bean** using various shape and dimension-based features. The focus was to uncover patterns in the data and assess the performance of a predictive model without using complex deep learning tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Dataset Summary\n",
    "- **Source**: [Dry Bean Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jtao/AdvancedML/main/data/Dry_Bean_Dataset.csv)\n",
    "- **Total Samples**: 13,611 dry bean images\n",
    "- **Features Used**: 13 numerical features (after dropping *Area*, *ConvexArea*, and *Class*)\n",
    "- **Target Variable**: `Perimeter` ‚Äì the length of the border of the bean.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Initial Data Exploration\n",
    "- No missing values were found in the dataset.\n",
    "- All features were numeric and suitable for regression modeling.\n",
    "- Summary statistics showed a diverse range of bean shapes and sizes, suggesting the dataset contains rich information for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Modeling Approach\n",
    "- **Model Used**: Scikit-Learn‚Äôs **Linear Regression**\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "  - Features were standardized using **StandardScaler**\n",
    "  - Data was split into **80% training** and **20% testing**\n",
    "- **Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Indicates average squared difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "  - **R¬≤ Score**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìà Model Performance\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: _(Insert value after running the model)_\n",
    "- **R¬≤ Score**: _(Insert value after running the model)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The R¬≤ score indicates the proportion of variance in the perimeter that can be explained by the selected features. While Linear Regression provides a basic baseline, performance could be improved further with more advanced models like **Random Forests or Support Vector Regressors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìâ Visualization\n",
    "A scatter plot comparing **actual vs predicted perimeter values** was generated. The closer the points lie to the diagonal red line, the better the model‚Äôs prediction accuracy. The plot demonstrated a generally consistent prediction performance with some dispersion, especially for higher perimeter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Key Insights\n",
    "- Basic shape and dimension features such as **MajorAxisLength, MinorAxisLength, Eccentricity, Roundness**, etc., provide meaningful signals to predict bean perimeter.\n",
    "- Even a simple linear regression model can capture the general trend between features and perimeter.\n",
    "- **Standardization** is critical for regression tasks involving features with different scales.\n",
    "- There is still room for improvement in model performance using more robust regression algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìå Future Work (Optional Enhancements)\n",
    "- Experiment with **non-linear models** like **Random Forest Regressor** or **Gradient Boosting**.\n",
    "- Perform **feature selection** to remove low-impact variables.\n",
    "- Explore **residual analysis** and error distributions.\n",
    "- Incorporate **cross-validation** for better generalization."
